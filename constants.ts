DISMISSED

Chapter One

The body was where bodies in New York City weren't supposed to be: floating face down in the Hudson River, bumping gently against the moss-covered pylons of an abandoned pier.

Rachel Chen stood at the edge of the police cordon, the familiar yellow tape fluttering in the pre-dawn breeze. Five years since she'd worn an FBI badge, and still, crime scenes called to her like an addiction she couldn't quite kick.

"You know you can't be here, Chen," Detective Morales said, ducking under the tape. His face was lined with exhaustion, coffee cup clutched in his hand like a lifeline.

"Good morning to you too, Ray." Rachel nodded toward the water where divers were preparing to retrieve the body. "Seems like overkill for a floater."

Morales shrugged. "ME says female, thirties. Well-dressed. No obvious signs of how she ended up in the drink."

Rachel felt the familiar itch, the need to get closer, to see for herself. "You checked missing persons?"

"Not your case, Chen." Morales took a long sip of coffee. "Don't you have some rich housewife's cheating husband to follow these days?"

The barb stung more than Rachel cared to admit. Private investigation paid the bills, but it wasn't why she'd spent twelve years in the Bureau.

"Got a client meeting," she said, turning away. "Just happened to be passing by."

Morales snorted. "Right. At five thirty in the morning."

Rachel's phone buzzed in her pocket—a text from a number she didn't recognize: Need to talk. About the body in the Hudson. $10,000 retainer. Plaza Hotel, 9AM.

She looked back at the river, where the divers were now carefully lifting the body into a waiting boat. Something about this felt wrong. And Rachel Chen had learned long ago to trust that feeling.
